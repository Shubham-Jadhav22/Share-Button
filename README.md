# Share-Button
A social media share button repository using HTML and CSS would likely contain the following files:

index.html - This is the main HTML file that contains the markup for the share button. It would include the necessary HTML tags such as <head>, <body>, <div>, and <button> to create the structure of the button.

style.css - This is the CSS file that contains the styles for the share button. It would include the necessary CSS properties such as font-size, color, background-color, padding, and border-radius to style the button to the desired design.

The HTML and CSS code for the share button would typically be structured using a combination of flexbox and grid layout techniques to ensure that the button is responsive and displays correctly on all devices. The CSS would also include media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

Overall, the repository would provide a reusable and customizable social media share button component that can be easily integrated into any website or web application.
